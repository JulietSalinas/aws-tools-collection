# aws-tools-collection
A small collection of simple tools for AWS.  I'll be adding to this as create new stuff.

###get-aws-nameservers.py	

Set your Access Key and Secret key as environment variables (e.g. using 'aws configure'), and run this directly.  It will pull down a list of all hosted zones in your account, and output a list of zones and their associated nameservers.
